## ⚙️ Quick Setup (2 Steps)

### Step 1: Update Database ID

**Find your Database ID in Appwrite:**
1. Go to Appwrite Console → Databases
2. Click on your database
3. Copy the Database ID from the URL or page header

**Update these 2 files:**

**File: `pages/AdminBankSettingsPage.tsx` (Line 27)**
```typescript
const DATABASE_ID = 'indaStreetDB'; // ← Replace with your actual Database ID
const COLLECTION_ID = 'bankAccounts'; // ← Keep this as is
```

**File: `pages/JobUnlockPaymentPage.tsx` (Line 29)**
```typescript
const DATABASE_ID = 'indaStreetDB'; // ← Replace with your actual Database ID
const COLLECTION_ID = 'bankAccounts'; // ← Keep this as is
const adminWhatsApp = '6281234567890'; // ← Replace with your WhatsApp number
```

### Step 2: Add Your First Bank

1. Navigate to: `http://localhost:3004/#adminBankSettings`
2. Click **"Add New Bank Account"**
3. Fill in the form:

| Field | Example | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| **Bank Name** | Bank Central Asia (BCA) | Full bank name |
| **Account Number** | 1234567890123456 | 16 digits max |
| **Account Name** | INDA STREET LTD | Account holder name |
| **Account Type** | savings | savings/checking/business |
| **Currency** | IDR | 3-letter currency code |
| **Balance** | 0 | Initial balance (default 0) |
| **Is Joint Account** | ☐ Unchecked | Check if joint account |
| **Primary Holder ID** | admin | User/admin ID |
| **Secondary Holder ID** | (leave empty) | Optional co-holder |
| **Active** | ☑ Checked | Show on payment page |

4. Click **"Add Bank Account"**
5. ✅ Done!
