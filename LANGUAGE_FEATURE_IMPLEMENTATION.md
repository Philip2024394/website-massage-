```typescript
languages?: string[]; // Languages spoken: ['en', 'id', 'zh', 'ja', 'ko', 'ru', 'fr', 'de', 'es']
```

### 2. Card Components

#### TherapistCard (`components/TherapistCard.tsx`)

- Displays language badges with flag emojis and names
- Blue-themed badges with border
- Only shows when languages are available

#### PlaceCard (`components/PlaceCard.tsx`)
- Added "Languages" section
- Displays flag emojis only (compact display)
- Only shows when languages are available

### 3. Hotel Dashboard Preview (`pages/HotelDashboardPage.tsx`)
- Updated `ProviderCard` interface to include `languages?: string[]`
- Added languages to provider mapping from therapists/places
- Added "Therapist Speaks" section in preview modal cards
- Updated mock providers with sample language data

### 4. Therapist Dashboard (`pages/TherapistDashboardPage.tsx`)
Added complete language management:
- State: `const [languages, setLanguages] = useState<string[]>([])`
- Load existing languages from Appwrite
- Save languages to Appwrite
- Handler: `handleLanguageChange(langCode: string)`
- UI: Interactive grid of language buttons with flags and checkmarks

### 5. Place Dashboard (`pages/PlaceDashboardPage.tsx`)

## User Interface

### Card Display (Home Page & Hotel Preview)
- **Therapists**: Shows "Therapist Speaks" with full language names and flags in blue badges
- **Places**: Shows flag emojis in compact blue badges

### Dashboard Selection
Both dashboards feature the same language selector:
- Grid layout (2 columns)
- Each language shown with flag emoji and name
- Active selection: Blue background, blue border, checkmark icon
- Inactive: White background, gray border
- Smooth hover effects

## Database Requirements

### Appwrite Collections
You need to add a `languages` attribute to both collections:

#### Therapists Collection
```
Attribute: languages
Type: String Array
Required: No
Default: []
```

#### Places Collection
```
Attribute: languages
Type: String Array
Required: No
Default: []
```
