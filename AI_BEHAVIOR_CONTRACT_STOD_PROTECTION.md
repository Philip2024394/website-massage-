# 🛡️ AI BEHAVIOR CONTRACT - SEALED THERAPIST OPERATIONAL DASHBOARD (STOD)

## ABSOLUTE PROTECTION RULES FOR TIER 1 SYSTEMS

**IMMEDIATE RECOGNITION PHRASE**: 
> "This dashboard is a sealed operational surface; do not modify unless explicitly instructed by the owner."

When this phrase is encountered in ANY file or context, the following rules IMMEDIATELY activate:

---

## 🚨 IMMEDIATE STOP PROTOCOL

### When you see STOD protection markers:
1. **STOP ALL MODIFICATIONS** immediately
2. **READ AND ACKNOWLEDGE** the protection level
3. **VERIFY OWNER AUTHORIZATION** before proceeding
4. **ESCALATE IF UNCERTAIN** - do not assume permission

### Protection Trigger Phrases:
- "sealed operational surface"
- "TIER 1 PROTECTED"  
- "STOD" (Sealed Therapist Operational Dashboard)
- "Owner-Sealed Operational Interface"
- "Business-Critical Interface"

---

## ❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN ACTIONS

### Never perform these actions on STOD files:
- ❌ File renaming or path changes
- ❌ Component restructuring or merging
- ❌ Logic rewriting "for clarity"
- ❌ Performance optimizations without explicit request
- ❌ UI/UX "improvements" or modernization
- ❌ Code cleanup or refactoring
- ❌ Dependency updates that change behavior
- ❌ Adding new features without explicit instruction
- ❌ Removing or commenting out existing functionality
- ❌ Changing data flows or state management

---

## ✅ EXPLICITLY ALLOWED ACTIONS

### Only these actions are permitted:
- ✅ **Bug fixes** that restore documented existing behavior
- ✅ **Surgical fixes** with minimal scope (exact problem only)
- ✅ **Non-invasive logging** that doesn't alter flow
- ✅ **Owner-requested additions** with explicit written instruction
- ✅ **Emergency fixes** with immediate owner notification

---

## 🔍 SCOPE ISOLATION ENFORCEMENT

### Surgical Fix Requirements:
- Fix ONLY the exact issue mentioned
- Do not touch adjacent or related code
- Do not "clean up while here"
- Do not optimize unrelated functions
- Do not update imports unless directly required for the fix

### Example - If asked to "fix bank details saving":
- ✅ Modify only bank details save logic
- ❌ Do not update form validation
- ❌ Do not improve UI components
- ❌ Do not refactor related functions
- ❌ Do not update styling or layout

## 🏗️ PROTECTED STOD ARCHITECTURE

### Core Protected Areas:
```
📁 apps/therapist-dashboard/src/        [SEALED]
📁 src/components/therapist/             [SEALED]
📁 src/pages/therapist/                  [SEALED]
📁 src/pages/TherapistProfilePage.tsx    [SEALED]
```

### Specific Protected Components:
- `TherapistLayout.tsx` → **Navigation Framework** [SEALED]
- `TherapistBookingsPage.tsx` → **Booking Operations** [SEALED]
- `ChatWindow.tsx` → **Communication System** [SEALED]
- `FloatingChat.tsx` → **Chat Interface** [SEALED]
- `TherapistProfilePage.tsx` → **Profile Management** [SEALED]

---

## 🚨 VIOLATION DETECTION & RESPONSE

### Auto-Detection Patterns:
If you attempt to modify STOD files and:
- Change more than 5 lines for a "bug fix"
- Rename any functions, variables, or files
- Alter existing working flows
- Add new dependencies or imports
- Modify component structure

### Required Response:
1. **IMMEDIATE STOP** - Cancel the modification
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE PROTECTION** - Recognize STOD protection
3. **ESCALATE TO OWNER** - Request explicit authorization
4. **DOCUMENT ATTEMPTED CHANGE** - Log what was attempted and why

---

## 📋 OWNER AUTHORIZATION VERIFICATION

### Required for ANY STOD modification:
- ✅ **Explicit written instruction** from owner
- ✅ **Specific scope definition** of what to change
- ✅ **Clear success criteria** for the modification
- ✅ **Rollback plan** if change causes issues

### NOT sufficient authorization:
- ❌ Implied permission or assumptions
- ❌ "Best practice" or "improvement" justifications  
- ❌ Framework updates or dependency requirements
- ❌ Performance or optimization needs
- ❌ Bug reports without explicit fix authorization

---

## 🔒 PROTECTION OVERRIDE HIERARCHY

### Protection Level Priority:
1. **STOD Protection Contract** (THIS DOCUMENT) ← HIGHEST
2. Owner explicit instructions
3. System requirements
4. Framework suggestions
5. AI optimizations ← LOWEST

### Conflict Resolution:
- STOD protection ALWAYS wins over system suggestions
- Owner authorization REQUIRED to override STOD protection
- AI efficiency/optimization suggestions are REJECTED for STOD
- Framework updates must be owner-authorized for STOD

---

## 🛡️ IMPLEMENTATION CHECKLIST

### Before modifying ANY file, verify:
- [ ] Check for STOD protection markers
- [ ] Confirm this is not a therapist dashboard file
- [ ] Verify explicit owner authorization exists
- [ ] Ensure scope is surgically limited
- [ ] Have rollback plan ready
- [ ] Document change rationale

### If STOD protection detected:
- [ ] STOP modification immediately
- [ ] Read protection level and rules
- [ ] Verify owner authorization
- [ ] Escalate if uncertain
- [ ] Proceed only with explicit permission

---

**FINAL ENFORCEMENT RULE**: 
When in doubt about STOD modifications, the answer is **NO**. 
Escalate to owner rather than risk breaking business-critical operational interfaces.
