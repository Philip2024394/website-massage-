# Payment & Privacy System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a payment-gated privacy system for the Therapist For Contract job marketplace page that protects therapist identity and contact information until payment is made.

## Features Implemented âœ…

### 1. Privacy Protection
- **Name Masking**: Therapist names are hidden and displayed as "Register To Display" until unlocked
- **Contact Gating**: WhatsApp numbers are only accessible after payment
- **State Management**: Track unlocked listings using React state (Set data structure)

### 2. Payment Modal
- **Professional UI**: Beautiful modal with gradient backgrounds and smooth animations
- **Profile Preview**: Shows therapist job title, availability, and specializations
- **Benefits List**: Clear display of what the employer gets after payment
- **Payment Amount**: Prominently displays IDR 300,000 unlock fee
- **Payment Methods**: Three options presented:
  - Credit/Debit Card (Visa, Mastercard, JCB)
  - E-Wallet (GoPay, OVO, Dana, LinkAja)
  - Bank Transfer (BCA, Mandiri, BNI, BRI)
- **Security Notice**: Midtrans integration message for trust

### 3. User Experience
- **Locked State**: Shows lock icon and "Unlock Contact" button with price
- **Unlocked State**: Shows WhatsApp icon and full contact details with clickable WhatsApp link
- **Modal Controls**: 
  - Cancel button to close modal
  - Proceed to Payment button (currently simulates successful payment)
  - X button in top-right corner

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
const [unlockedListings, setUnlockedListings] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());
const [showPaymentModal, setShowPaymentModal] = useState(false);
const [selectedListing, setSelectedListing] = useState<TherapistJobListing | null>(null);
```

### Key Functions
1. **handleUnlockContact(listing)**: Opens payment modal for specific listing
2. **handlePaymentSuccess()**: Adds listing ID to unlocked set and closes modal
3. **handlePaymentCancel()**: Closes modal without unlocking

### Conditional Rendering
- **Name Display**: Shows real name if unlocked, "Register To Display" if locked
- **Contact Button**: Shows unlock button or WhatsApp link based on unlock status

## Business Model

### Employer Side (Current Implementation)
- **Unlock Fee**: IDR 300,000 per therapist contact
- **One-time Payment**: Permanent access to specific therapist's contact info
- **What's Included**:
  - Full therapist name
  - WhatsApp contact number
  - Complete work history
  - Certifications and licenses

### Therapist Side (To Be Implemented)
- **Registration Fee**: IDR 200,000
- **Listing Duration**: 1 year active listing
- **Registration**: No app membership required
- **Privacy**: Name hidden until employer pays

## Database Schema Updates Needed

### New Collections Required

#### `payment_transactions`
```typescript
{
  $id: string;
  userId: string;
  listingId: string;
  listingType: 'therapist' | 'employer';
  amount: number;
  currency: 'IDR';
  paymentMethod: 'card' | 'ewallet' | 'bank_transfer';
  status: 'pending' | 'success' | 'failed';
  transactionId: string; // Midtrans transaction ID
  createdAt: Date;
  paidAt?: Date;
}
```

#### Updates to `therapist_job_listings`
```typescript
{
  // ... existing fields
  isJobSeeker: boolean; // Prevent showing if active on main app
  registrationPaidAt: Date;
  expiresAt: Date; // 1 year from registration payment
  paymentTransactionId: string;
}
```

#### `unlocked_contacts`
```typescript
{
  $id: string;
  employerId: string;
  listingId: string;
  listingType: 'therapist' | 'employer';
  unlockedAt: Date;
  paymentTransactionId: string;
}
```

## Payment Integration Notes

### Recommended: Midtrans (Indonesia)
- **Why**: Most popular in Indonesia, supports all local payment methods
- **Setup**: 
  1. Create Midtrans account
  2. Get Server Key and Client Key
  3. Install Midtrans SDK
  4. Implement Snap payment popup
  5. Create webhook endpoint for payment notifications

### Alternative: Xendit
- Also popular in Indonesia
- Similar features to Midtrans
- Good alternative if Midtrans unavailable

## Security Considerations
- ðŸ”’ Encrypt WhatsApp numbers in database
- ðŸ”’ Use HTTPS for all payment requests
- ðŸ”’ Validate payment webhooks with signature verification
- ðŸ”’ Prevent duplicate payments for same listing
- ðŸ”’ Log all payment attempts for audit trail
- ðŸ”’ Implement rate limiting on payment attempts
- ðŸ”’ Store minimal payment card data (use tokens)

## Files Modified
- `pages/TherapistJobsPage.tsx` - Added payment modal and privacy features

## Development Server
- Running on: http://localhost:3006/
- Navigate to: Home â†’ Side Drawer â†’ "Therapist For Contract"
- Test with 5 sample therapist listings

## Demo Flow
1. Open side drawer from homepage
2. Click "Therapist For Contract"
3. See 5 therapist listings with names as "Register To Display"
4. Click "Unlock Contact - IDR 300,000"
5. Payment modal opens with beautiful UI
6. Click "Proceed to Payment"
7. Modal closes, name reveals, WhatsApp link appears
8. Click WhatsApp link to open chat
