❌ Facial Clinic Button: INCORRECT AUTH  
   - Should check for facial profile in facial_places collection

YOUR CURRENT PROBLEM:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

You're trying to sign in as MASSAGE THERAPIST ✅
This is the CORRECT dashboard for your profile (Surtiningsih) ✅
The button IS connected to the right dashboard (port 3003) ✅

The issue is NOT wrong dashboard - it's:
1. Collection permission (Users role needs READ)
2. Profile linkage (agentId must match user ID)

Current agentId in database: 693cfadf000997d3cd66
You need to confirm this matches your actual Appwrite user ID


RECOMMENDATION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Fix the therapist dashboard issue FIRST, then:
1. Update place-dashboard to verify place profile
2. Update facial-dashboard to verify facial profile  
3. Add hotel-villa-dashboard with proper auth
