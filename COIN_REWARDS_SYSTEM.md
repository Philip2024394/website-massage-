## ‚è∞ Coin Expiration Policy

### Expiration Rules

**12-Month Validity Period:**
- All earned coins expire 12 months from earning date
- Expiration tracked per transaction (FIFO method)
- Oldest coins used first when redeeming

### FIFO (First In, First Out) System

**Example:**
```
User has 300 coins:
- 100 coins earned Jan 2025 (expires Jan 2026)
- 150 coins earned Mar 2025 (expires Mar 2026)
- 50 coins earned Oct 2025 (expires Oct 2026)

When user redeems 175 coins:
1. Deduct 100 from Jan 2025 batch (all used)
2. Deduct 75 from Mar 2025 batch (75 remaining)
3. Oct 2025 batch untouched (50 remaining)

New balance: 125 coins (75 + 50)
```

### Notification System

**30 Days Before Expiration:**
- Email notification
- Push notification
- In-app warning banner

**7 Days Before Expiration:**
