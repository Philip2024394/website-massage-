## 🔧 Important Field Name Changes

Your Appwrite collection uses **lowercase** field names in some cases. The code has been updated to match:

| Code Variable | Appwrite Attribute | Type |
|---------------|-------------------|------|
| `massageTypes` | `massagetypes` | String Array |
| `whatsappSent` | `whatsappsent` | Boolean |
| `whatsappSentAt` | `whatsappsentat` | String |
| `selectedPlanPrice` | `selectedplanprice` | String |

⚠️ **Note**: Appwrite field names are **case-sensitive**! The code now uses the exact lowercase names.

## 📝 Field Type Mappings

### Appwrite → Code Conversions:

| Appwrite Type | Code Handling | Example |
|---------------|---------------|---------|
| `required string` | Sent directly | `jobTitle: formData.jobTitle` |
| `optional string` | Sent if provided | `...(formData.location && { location: ... })` |
| `required boolean` | Sent with default | `accommodationProvided: formData.accommodationProvided \|\| false` |
| `integer` | Sent as number | `views: 0`, `numberOfPositions: 1` |
| `string array` | Sent if has items | `...(formData.requirements.length > 0 && { requirements: ... })` |
| `datetime` | ISO string | `postedDate: new Date().toISOString()` |

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### ❌ Error: "Unknown attribute: [field_name]"
**Cause**: Field name mismatch between code and Appwrite  
**Solution**: Check if Appwrite uses lowercase (e.g., `massagetypes` not `massageTypes`)

### ❌ Error: "Invalid document structure"
**Cause**: Type mismatch (sending string to integer field, etc.)  
**Solution**: Check field types in Appwrite match the data being sent

### ❌ WhatsApp tracking not working
**Cause**: Missing lowercase field names  
**Solution**: Already fixed! Code now uses `whatsappsent`, `whatsappsentat`, `selectedplanprice`

### ❌ Arrays not saving
**Cause**: Sending empty arrays  
**Solution**: Already handled! Code only sends arrays if they have items
