<button onClick={() => setShowChatWindow(true)}>
  <MessageCircle />
  {unreadChatCount > 0 && <span>{unreadChatCount}</span>}
</button>

// Add chat window
{showChatWindow && (
  <MemberChatWindow
    userId={therapistId}
    userName={therapistName}
    userType="therapist"

## 🔒 Security Features

### Phone Number Protection

**Why It's Critical:**
- Platform revenue depends on bookings through the system
- Direct contact = revenue loss
- Users could bypass platform by sharing WhatsApp/phone numbers

**How It Works:**
1. All messages validated before sending
2. Multiple detection methods (digits, words, patterns, substitutions)
3. Clear error messages shown to users
4. Admin exempt from all restrictions
5. Legitimate numbers (prices, times) allowed

**Protection Level:**
- ✅ Blocks: "08123456789"
- ✅ Blocks: "0812 345 6789"
- ✅ Blocks: "zero eight one two..."
- ✅ Blocks: "call me at 0812"
- ✅ Blocks: "o8i234s678" (substitutions)
- ✅ Allows: "$500 per session"
- ✅ Allows: "Open 9am-5pm"
- ✅ Allows: "Room 234"
