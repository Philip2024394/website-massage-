## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Multiple Banks**: Add multiple banks (BCA, Mandiri, BNI, BRI) for user flexibility
2. **Test Mode**: Keep one bank inactive for testing inactive state
3. **Backup**: Export bank data from Appwrite periodically
4. **Security**: Restrict Create/Update/Delete permissions to admin role only
5. **Monitoring**: Check Appwrite logs if banks don't appear on payment page
