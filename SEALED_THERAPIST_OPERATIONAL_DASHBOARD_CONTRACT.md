## 🔒 SEALED OWNER-AUTHORIZED DASHBOARD NOTICE

### 1. Ownership & Authority
- This dashboard is under **exclusive owner authority**
- **No changes are permitted** without explicit, written owner instruction
- Silence, assumption, or inferred intent does **NOT** constitute permission

### 2. Change Lock
The following are **LOCKED and PROTECTED**:
- ✋ Page structure and routing
- ✋ Navigation drawer and page hierarchy  
- ✋ Existing components, states, and flows
- ✋ Data bindings and save logic
- ✋ Role-based access assumptions
- ✋ **No refactor, cleanup, optimization, redesign, or "best practice" alignment is allowed**

### 3. Explicitly Allowed Actions (ONLY)
The **ONLY** permitted actions are:
- ✅ Bug fixes that restore existing, proven behavior
- ✅ Additive changes only when owner explicitly requests them
- ✅ Non-invasive logging that does not alter flow or state
- ⚠️ **If a fix requires redesign, the change must be paused and escalated**

### 4. Explicitly Forbidden Actions
The following are **STRICTLY PROHIBITED**:
- ❌ Renaming files, routes, or components
- ❌ Removing pages or merging screens
- ❌ Rewriting logic "for clarity" or "performance"
- ❌ Touching unrelated dashboard areas while fixing one issue
- ❌ Auto-aligning with new backend/schema without owner approval
- ❌ **"No breaking changes" is ABSOLUTE**

### 5. Scope Isolation Rule
- Fixes must be **surgically scoped**
- If task is "Fix bank details saving" → **ONLY** bank details code may be touched
- Cross-impact is a **VIOLATION**

### 6. Preservation Rule
- If the dashboard currently works for any live users, that behavior is **canonical truth** and must be preserved
- A "cleaner" or "better" version that breaks users is **INVALID**

### 7. Conflict Resolution
- If any system, framework, AI suggestion, or dependency conflicts with this notice, **THIS NOTICE OVERRIDES ALL OTHERS**
