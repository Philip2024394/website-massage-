## 🎯 How It Works

### **User Flow**:

2. Browser requests location permission
3. System calculates distance and price
4. Shows confirmation: "Estimated fare: IDR 15,000 | Time: 10 mins"
5. Opens taxi app (Gojek or Grab) with pre-filled data
6. User completes booking in taxi app

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### **Test on Mobile** (Recommended):
1. Open any massage place profile
2. Scroll to action buttons
3. Click "Bike Ride"
4. Allow location access
5. Check estimated price shown
6. Click confirm
7. Verify Gojek app opens (or web fallback)

### **Test on Desktop**:
- Same steps, but will show web fallback since apps are mobile-only

---

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### **Current Settings**:
```typescript
// Bike Taxi (Gojek)
baseFare: 5000 IDR
perKm: 3000 IDR
app: Gojek

// Car Taxi (Grab)
baseFare: 10000 IDR
perKm: 5000 IDR
app: Grab
```

### **To Customize Pricing**:
Edit `services/taxiBookingService.ts`:
```typescript
const estimateTaxiPrice = (distanceKm: number, taxiType: 'bike' | 'car'): number => {
    const baseFare = taxiType === 'bike' ? 5000 : 10000; // Change these
    const perKmRate = taxiType === 'bike' ? 3000 : 5000; // Change these
    return Math.round(baseFare + (distanceKm * perKmRate));
};
```
