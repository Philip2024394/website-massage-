## 🔗 Get Your Appwrite Collection IDs

### Quick Access Link:
**Direct link to your database:** https://cloud.appwrite.io/console/project-68f23b11000d25eb3664/databases/database-68f76ee1000e64ca8d05

### Steps to Get Collection IDs:

1. **Go to the link above** (it should take you directly to your database)
2. **Login to your Appwrite account** if needed
3. **You'll see a list of collections** in your database
4. **For each collection:**
   - Click on the collection name
   - Copy the Collection ID from the top of the page (it's a long string like `68f76ee1000e64ca8d05`)

### Expected Collections:
You should find collections with names similar to:
- **therapists** (or similar)
- **places** (or similar) 
- **users** (or similar)
- **bookings** (or similar)
- **hotels** (or similar)
- **reviews** (or similar)
- **notifications** (or similar)
- **chats** or **messages** (or similar)
- **coins** or **loyalty** (or similar)

### After Getting the IDs:
Once you have the real collection IDs, I'll help you update the `appwrite.config.ts` file to replace all the placeholder values with the real ones.

### Current Status:
✅ Your app is working with mock data  
✅ Navigation is working perfectly  
✅ All 91 pages are accessible  
⏳ Need real collection IDs to enable live Appwrite data feed  

### If Collections Don't Exist:
If you don't see any collections in your database, that means they need to be created first. Let me know and I can help you set up the basic collections structure.
