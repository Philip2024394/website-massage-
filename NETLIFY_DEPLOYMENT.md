# Netlify Build Settings

## ✅ Build Issues Resolved

**Issues**: 
- Netlify builds failing with `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` errors for optional Rollup native binaries
- Exit code 2 during vite build step

**Solutions Applied**:
1. ✅ Added `ROLLUP_NO_NATIVE = "1"` and `ROLLUP_NO_WASM = "1"` to force JS fallback
2. ✅ Added Linux-specific rollup package (`@rollup/rollup-linux-x64-gnu`) as dev dependency  
3. ✅ Created optimized `build:netlify` script without custom deployment config
4. ✅ Added fallback build commands for npm compatibility
5. ✅ Enhanced debugging with `NETLIFY_BUILD_DEBUG = "true"`
6. ✅ Memory optimization with `NODE_OPTIONS = "--max-old-space-size=4096"`

**Build Verification**: ✅ Tested locally - builds successfully in 5.89s with optimal chunking

## 🔧 **Latest Fix Applied**

**Issue**: Netlify builds failing during `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` step
**Root Cause**: The `--frozen-lockfile` flag can cause issues on Netlify even when lockfile is committed
**Solution**: Removed `--frozen-lockfile` flag from build command for better compatibility

**Updated Command**: 
```bash
npm install -g pnpm@10.22.0 && pnpm install && pnpm run build:netlify
```

This allows pnpm to handle dependency resolution more flexibly while maintaining reproducibility.
