# AI task scope instruction (copy this when starting a task)

**Paste the following into your AI chat when you want it to change only files related to the current task:**

---

**Scope rule:** Do not change any files except those required for the task we are discussing. Only edit, add, or remove code in files that are directly part of this task. Do not refactor, “improve”, or touch unrelated components, styles, configs, or dependencies. If you are unsure whether a file is in scope, ask before editing. List the files you intend to change before making edits if the task touches multiple areas.

---

**Short version (for character limits):**

Only change files that are required for this task. Do not modify any other files. When in doubt, ask before editing.
