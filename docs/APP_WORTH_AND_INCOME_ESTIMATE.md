# App Worth & Estimated Monthly Income

**Platform:** IndastreetMassage  
**Revenue model:** Commission on completed bookings (therapist/place 30%; hotel/villa 12%)  
**Source:** Business logic, competitive analysis, live booking spec

## Revenue model (what you earn)

| Stream | Commission | Who pays |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **Therapist & place bookings** | **30%** of booking value | Provider pays platform after completed booking |
| **Hotel / villa bookings** | **12%** of booking value | From hotel/villa side |

- Customer pays provider (cash or direct bank); provider then pays platform commission.  
- No payment gateway fees; gross margin on commission is high.

## Estimated monthly income

### Today (pre-scale, illustrative)

Assume you have limited active therapists and places and few hotel/villa partners:

| Scenario | Active providers | Bookings/month | Avg booking (IDR) | GMV/month (IDR) | Platform revenue (30%) |
|---------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| **Early** | ~50 | ~600 | 250,000 | 150M | **45M** (~\$3k USD) |
| **Growing** | ~200 | ~2,400 | 250,000 | 600M | **180M** (~\$12k USD) |

*Hotel/villa: add ~12% on that stream when active (e.g. 5% of total GMV from hotels → extra ~5–10% on total platform revenue).*

### Year 1 target (from your roadmap)

From **COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS_INDONESIA_2026.md**:

- **1,000 active therapists**
- **4 bookings/day per therapist** → 120 bookings/therapist/month → 120,000 bookings/month
- **Average Rp 250,000 per booking**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|--------|
| **Monthly GMV** | **Rp 3 billion** (~\$200k USD) |
| **Annual GMV** | Rp 36 billion (~\$2.4M USD) |
| **Platform revenue (30%)** | **Rp 900 million/month** (~\$60k USD) |
| **Annual platform revenue** | **Rp 10.8 billion** (~\$720k USD) |

So **estimated monthly income at Year 1 target ≈ Rp 900 million (~\$60k USD)**, before hotel/villa and other streams.

### Phase 2 (Month 7–12)

- 2,000 therapists, 50,000 customers  
- If bookings scale roughly with therapists: **~Rp 1.8–2 billion/month** platform revenue (~\$120–130k USD/month) is a reasonable range.

## What is the app worth? (valuation ranges)

Valuation depends on stage, traction, and method. Below are **illustrative ranges**, not guarantees.

### 1. Revenue multiple (for when you have recurring revenue)

- Early-stage marketplace/tech: **2–5× ARR** common; strong growth can justify **5–10× ARR**.
- **Year 1 ARR** (platform only): Rp 10.8B ≈ **\$720k USD**.
  - **2× ARR:** ~\$1.4M  
  - **5× ARR:** ~\$3.6M  
  - **10× ARR:** ~\$7.2M  

So **app worth (revenue-based) at Year 1 target:** roughly **\$1.4M–\$7.2M** depending on growth and risk.

### 2. GMV multiple (marketplace)

- Some investors value marketplaces at **0.3–1× annual GMV** (early stage).
- **Year 1 GMV:** Rp 36B ≈ **\$2.4M USD**.
  - **0.3×:** ~\$720k  
  - **0.5×:** ~\$1.2M  
  - **1×:** ~\$2.4M  

So **app worth (GMV-based) at Year 1 target:** roughly **\$0.7M–\$2.4M**.

### 3. Asset / build-cost value (today, pre-revenue)

- Replacement cost of the product: full-stack platform (client, therapist, place, hotel/villa, facial, multi-country, booking, commission, trust, PWA, etc.).
- A comparable build often **\$200k–\$600k+** (agency/dev cost).
- **Asset value (today):** often cited in the **\$200k–\$500k** range for a product of this scope, even before meaningful GMV.

### Summary table (illustrative)

| Basis | Range (USD) | When it applies |
|-------|-------------|------------------|
| **Asset / build cost** | \$200k–\$500k | Today (pre-scale) |
| **GMV multiple (0.3–1×)** | \$0.7M–\$2.4M | At Year 1 GMV target |
| **Revenue multiple (2–10× ARR)** | \$1.4M–\$7.2M | At Year 1 revenue target |

**Practical takeaway:**

- **Today:** App worth is often in the **\$200k–\$500k** range (asset/code + IP + design), depending on how one values the build.
- **At Year 1 target:** With **Rp 900M/month** platform revenue and **Rp 36B** GMV, a reasonable **valuation range is ~\$1M–\$3M** (conservative to mid); with strong growth and traction, **\$3M–\$7M** is in line with revenue multiples used for similar early-stage marketplaces.

## Assumptions and risks

- **Commission:** 30% (therapist/place) and 12% (hotel/villa) as per your codebase and docs.  
- **Take-rate:** Assumes providers pay commission as designed; collection rate and timing can affect actual cash flow.  
- **Volume:** Year 1 numbers assume 1,000 active therapists and 4 bookings/day per therapist; actuals will depend on supply acquisition and demand.  
- **FX:** USD at ~Rp 15,000 (adjust for current rate).  
- **Valuation:** Multiples are market- and investor-dependent; they are ranges, not offers.

---

**Bottom line**

- **Estimated monthly income at Year 1 target:** **~Rp 900 million (~\$60k USD)** from therapist/place commission, plus any hotel/villa (12%) and other revenue.  
- **App worth today:** on the order of **\$200k–\$500k** (asset/build value).  
- **App worth at Year 1 target:** on the order of **\$1M–\$3M** (conservative), up to **\$3M–\$7M** if valued on revenue growth and traction.
