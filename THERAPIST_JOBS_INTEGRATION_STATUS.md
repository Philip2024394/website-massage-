## ⚠️ Current Issues

### Issue #1: Browser Cache (CRITICAL)
**Problem:** Browser is aggressively caching the old `App.tsx` file
**Evidence:**
- Missing log: `🔥🔥🔥 APP.TSX LOADED - VERSION: 2024-10-31-10:00:00-FIX-CALLBACK`
- Error: `⚠️ onCreateTherapistProfile not provided!`
- Callback exists in code but not executing

**Solution:**
```
Option A: Use Incognito/Private Mode
  - Chrome/Edge: Ctrl + Shift + N
  - Firefox: Ctrl + Shift + P
  - Go to http://localhost:3000
  
Option B: Nuclear Cache Clear
  - F12 → Right-click refresh → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
  - Or: Browser Settings → Clear all cached files
  
Option C: Different Browser
  - Try a browser you haven't used for this project
```

### Issue #2: Appwrite Authentication (SECONDARY)
**Problem:** 401 errors when fetching therapist listings as guest user
**Error:**
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401
User (role: guests) missing scopes (["account"])
```

**Root Cause:**
- Appwrite collection permissions don't allow guest (unauthenticated) users to read therapist listings
- Session manager trying to check account status for guests

**Solution:**
1. **Fix Appwrite Permissions:**
   - Go to Appwrite Console
   - Navigate to Database → `therapist_job_listings` collection
   - Under Permissions → Add Read permission for `role:guests` or `role:all`

2. **Fix Session Manager (Optional):**
```typescript
// In sessionManager.ts line 19-25
export async function restoreSession(): Promise<SessionUser | null> {
    try {
        const user = await account.get();
        // ... rest of code
    } catch (error: any) {
        // This is normal for guest users - don't log as error
        if (error.code !== 401) {
            console.error('Session error:', error);
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```
