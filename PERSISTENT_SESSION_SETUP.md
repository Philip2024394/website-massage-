# 🔒 Persistent Session Setup - Complete Guide

## ✅ **STATUS: FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

Your app now has **persistent authentication** across all sections. Users won't need to log in repeatedly!

---

## 🎯 **What Was Implemented**

### **1. Session Manager (`lib/sessionManager.ts`)**
A new service that:
- ✅ Checks for active Appwrite sessions on app load
- ✅ Automatically identifies user type (Admin, Hotel, Villa, Agent, Therapist, Place, User)
- ✅ Restores user state without requiring login
- ✅ Handles logout across all sections
- ✅ Clears sessions properly

### **2. Auto-Login on App Start**
Modified `App.tsx` to:
- ✅ Call `restoreSession()` when app loads
- ✅ Detect which user type is logged in
- ✅ Restore dashboard/page state automatically
- ✅ Navigate to the correct page for each user type

### **3. Proper Logout**
All logout functions now:
- ✅ Clear Appwrite session via `account.deleteSession('current')`
- ✅ Clear localStorage cache
- ✅ Reset all app state
- ✅ Return user to home page

---

## 📋 **What You Need from Appwrite**

### **✅ NOTHING! Everything is Already Set Up**

Appwrite automatically:
- Stores session cookies in the browser
- Maintains sessions across page refreshes
- Keeps users logged in for 365 days (default)
- Handles session security

**The problem was in the code, not Appwrite!** The app wasn't checking for existing sessions. Now it does.

---

## 🔧 **How It Works**

### **Login Flow:**

1. **User logs in** (Admin/Hotel/Villa/Agent/Therapist/Place)
   - Login page calls Appwrite auth (e.g., `therapistAuth.signIn()`)
   - Appwrite creates session and stores cookie
   - App navigates to dashboard

2. **Session is stored** in:
   - Appwrite cookies (secure, httpOnly)
   - localStorage cache (for quick offline check)

### **Page Refresh/Revisit Flow:**

1. **App loads** → `useEffect` runs
2. **`restoreSession()` called**
3. **Checks** if Appwrite session exists via `account.get()`
4. **If session exists:**
   - Identifies user type by checking collections
   - Restores state (admin/hotel/villa/agent/therapist/place)
   - Navigates to correct dashboard
5. **If no session:**
   - Shows landing page
   - User can browse as guest

### **Logout Flow:**

1. **User clicks logout**
2. **`sessionLogout()` called**
3. **Clears:**
   - Appwrite session via `account.deleteSession()`
   - localStorage cache
   - All app state
4. **Returns to home page**

## 🚀 **User Experience Now**

### **Before (Problem):**
- ❌ Admin logs in → Closes tab → Must log in again
- ❌ Hotel logs in → Refreshes page → Must log in again
- ❌ Therapist logs in → Navigates away → Must log in again

### **After (Solution):**
- ✅ Admin logs in → Closes tab → **Automatically logged in** on return
- ✅ Hotel logs in → Refreshes page → **Stays logged in**
- ✅ Therapist logs in → Navigates away → **Returns to dashboard**
- ✅ All user types stay logged in for **365 days** (or until logout)

## 🎨 **Session Restore by User Type**

| User Type | Restored To | State Restored |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| **Admin** | `adminDashboard` | `isAdminLoggedIn = true` |
| **Hotel** | `hotelDashboard` | `isHotelLoggedIn = true`, `loggedInUser` set |
| **Villa** | `villaDashboard` | `isVillaLoggedIn = true`, `loggedInUser` set |
| **Agent** | `agentDashboard` | `loggedInAgent` set with full data |
| **Therapist** | `therapistStatus` | `loggedInProvider` set |
| **Place** | `placeDashboard` | `loggedInProvider` set |
| **Guest User** | `home` | `user` set |

---

## 🔐 **Security Features**

✅ **Secure cookies** - Appwrite handles session storage securely
✅ **HttpOnly cookies** - Protected from XSS attacks
✅ **Auto-expiry** - Sessions expire after inactivity
✅ **Single session** - New login clears old sessions
✅ **Logout everywhere** - `deleteSession('current')` logs out completely

---

## 🧪 **Testing the Implementation**

### **Test 1: Login Persistence**
1. Go to Hotel Login → Sign in
2. Close browser tab
3. Reopen website → **Should be on Hotel Dashboard** ✅

### **Test 2: Page Refresh**
1. Login as Therapist
2. Refresh page (F5)
3. **Should stay on Therapist Dashboard** ✅

### **Test 3: Different User Types**
1. Login as Admin → See Admin Dashboard
2. Logout → Login as Agent → See Agent Dashboard
3. Refresh → **Should stay on Agent Dashboard** ✅

### **Test 4: Logout**
1. Login as any user type
2. Click logout
3. Refresh page → **Should be on Landing/Home page** ✅

## 📊 **Technical Details**

### **Collections Checked (in order):**
1. `admins` - Admin users
2. `HOTELS_COLLECTION_ID` - Hotels
3. `villas` - Villas
4. `AGENTS_COLLECTION_ID` - Agents
5. `THERAPISTS_COLLECTION_ID` - Therapists
6. `PLACES_COLLECTION_ID` - Massage places
7. `USERS_COLLECTION_ID` - Regular users/guests

### **Session Duration:**
- Default: **365 days** (Appwrite default)
- Can be configured in Appwrite Console → Settings → Sessions

### **Storage:**
- **Appwrite Cookies**: Primary session storage (secure)
- **localStorage**: Cache for quick type detection (backup)

---

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Problem: Still logging out after refresh**
**Solution:** Check Appwrite Console:
1. Go to Auth → Sessions
2. Verify session was created
3. Check session duration settings
4. Ensure cookies are enabled in browser

### **Problem: Wrong user type detected**
**Solution:** 
1. Check email exists in correct collection
2. Clear localStorage: `localStorage.clear()`
3. Logout and login again

### **Problem: "No session found" in console**
**Solution:** This is normal if:
- User hasn't logged in yet
- Session expired
- User logged out
- Cookies were cleared
