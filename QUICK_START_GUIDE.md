## ⚡ 5-Minute Setup (Critical Items Only)

### 1. Add Appwrite Database Attributes (5 mins)

Open your Appwrite console and add these 4 attributes to the `employer_job_postings` collection:

| Attribute Name | Type | Required | Default |
|----------------|------|----------|---------|
| `flightsPaidByEmployer` | Boolean | No | `false` |
| `visaArrangedByEmployer` | Boolean | No | `false` |
| `transportationProvided` | String (50 chars) | No | `none` |
| `isActive` | Boolean | No | `false` |

**Detailed Instructions:** See `APPWRITE_ATTRIBUTES_SETUP.md`

### 2. Update Environment Variables (2 mins)

Edit the `.env` file and update these critical values:

```env
# Update with your actual Appwrite credentials
VITE_APPWRITE_ENDPOINT=https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1
VITE_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-actual-project-id
VITE_APPWRITE_DATABASE_ID=your-actual-database-id

# Verify these are correct
VITE_WHATSAPP_SUPPORT=6281392000050
VITE_SUPPORT_EMAIL=support@indastreet.com

# Confirm bank details
VITE_BANK_NAME=BCA
VITE_BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER=1234567890
VITE_BANK_ACCOUNT_NAME=IndaStreet
```

### 3. Test Locally (3 mins)

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not done)
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Test these flows:
# 1. Create a job posting
# 2. Go to payment page
# 3. Click WhatsApp button (verify number)
# 4. Check free membership badges appear
```

### 4. Build for Production (1 min)

```bash
npm run build
```

If successful, you'll see:
- ✅ No errors
